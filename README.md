# Intro to Web Development

This is meant to provide an idea of what is web development on a high level, if you're considering a career in it.

I'm doing this for a couple of my friends that are interested in this, but hopefully someone else can find it useful.
I'll be streaming on Twitch (link to follow) on Sunday, 1st of Novemeber at 4pm.
If the quality is good enough, I'll probably leave it on the channel.

## Plan on high level

I'll be looping back and forth between some subjects, potentially going deeper into them so it would make (hopefully) more sense.

### Architecture and technologies

This is just to establish some language, so we know what we're talking about ;]

Frontend, backend, programming languages and different parts of software engineering.

### Software engineering tools

A terminal, version control, IDE, testing tools, code quality tools and communication.

### Business environment

This one is gonna be less technical, but I think it's crucial to have better udnerstanding what the job really is like.

Will talk a little about different company and employment types, roles within those companies and methodologies used to run companies and/or teams.
I'll touch on job searching on high level and finally a day to day work, which is probably quite interesting.

### Workshop

We will build a _very_ basic website and deploy it, so it's available on the web for others to see, by using a small subset of abovementioned tools.

Obviously, we'll make it cost us nothing, but time and a little bit of effort ;]
